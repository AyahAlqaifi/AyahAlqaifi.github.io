										<h1>Sustainability</h1>

									<p>Sustainability is now seen as the business paradigm for the 21st century (Garcia, et al., 2014). Sustainability accounting data helps people make better decisions because it has value-relevant skills. Managers can determine the meaning and relevance of an entity's day-to-day actions by using accounting data. The information collected through this can help in aiding the decision-making process. For instance, throughout the research that I have done on tesla, I have come up with many new skills that have contributed to my knowledge growth in the research field. To start off my research, firstly I did a background check on the company “Tesla” and got a main idea of their strengths and weakness and what are their goals and future ambitions, after that I checked their sustainability report and compared this year’s report to the previous year, to see what has been achieved and what is still vague. Then I read a few articles and journals on the company’s image and concluded some personal insights. 
										For instance, Leadership roles, which require decision-making, ultimately determine organisational performance, and in our case, it was Elton musk decisions that highlighted the importance of making choices based on a thorough decision-making process by understanding the economic growth market and the ability to use available data, particularly accounting data; in addition to financial and sustainability reports to enhance the decision-making process.</p>
									<p>I have learnt that many organizations today operate in a very competitive market, demanding that both the manager and the stakeholder to make knowledgeable decisions and to check the vitality of the reports that they are receiving. It may no longer be effective to judge performance without taking sustainability into accounting in today's business environment. Take for example, managing sustainability, where according to (Csutora & Szerenyi, 2008) sustainability accounting and performance measurement are linked in numerous ways, wherein sustainability can help organisations gain a competitive advantage by improving strategic implementation, efficiency, and day-to-day operations. As a result, it's possible that businesses might profit from the sustainability data, and that being sustainable can give a company a competitive edge that enhances financial performance.</p>
									<p>All throughout my research I have learnt many new skills such as written communication, by reading and researching further, contributing to strengthen my grammar and vocabulary, including that I have become better at analysing websites to conclude if they carry information relevant to my research through quick skimming and scanning, helping me to gain advanced knowledge in data collection to produce the correct suitable information necessary for critical analysis and evaluation of my given topic research. In conclusion sustainability information can help in making the decision-making process better and more efficient, and that these skills that I have gained will help me improve my life and future in many ways.</p>
